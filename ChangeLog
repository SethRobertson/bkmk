	* Make.production (Repository): added BK_JAVA_CP to classpath

2001-11-30  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.variables (JAVACFLAGS): flags for javac
	(BK_JAVA_*): file list variables for Java production rules
	(BK_JAVA_ICLASS_TMP): can't use $(wildcard) for this--it doesn't
	see newly created files--so go back to $(shell echo)

	* Make.targets (test): compile Java test classes
	(.PHONY): add recent targets to list

	* Make.production (Make%,.depen%): prevent implicit rule recursion
	(.SUFFIXES): prevent implicit rule recursion for java/class/etc. files
	(BK_JAVA_*): move JAVA variables to Make.variables
	($(subst .class,.cl%ss,$(BK_JAVA_PKG_CLASS))): really make single
	javac invocation work, using multiple-target "pattern rules"
	($(BK_JAVA_JAR)): no longer depends on test classes

2001-11-29  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.production: tweak internal class support so that wildcard
	expansion is done at jar time [after compiler has generated all
	internal .class files]; modify javac compilation rule to operate
	on all of BK_JAVA_SRC or BK_JAVA_TEST at once, which is much more
	efficient given the way the javac compiler works; use wildcard to
	find locale bundle files without needing Makefile support

	* Make.production (BK_JAVA_ICLASS): support for internal classes.

2001-11-28  James Tanis  <jtt@winwood.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.variables (COPTDEBUG+): Turn off optimization when INSIGHT
	on to "suppress" message indicating that INSIGHT is dropping
	optimizations :-)

2001-11-28  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* ex.pkg.Make.preinclude (BK_INSTALLBASE): use this consistently
	instead of BK_INSTALLBASEDIR; GNUmakefiles modified to use this

	* Make.production: do better at linking files into JAVA directory
	tree on systems where symbolic links aren't fully supported

	* ex.pkg.Makefile (BK_LOCALCLEANJUNK): add JAVA directory

2001-11-27  Seth Robertson  <seth@startide.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.variables (COMPILER_DEBUG): Add missing-prototypes or
	strict-prototypes

2001-11-27  Matt Miller  <matt@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.{variables,targets}: force makefile-mode in emacs.

	* Make.variables: added *.class to BK_STDJUNK

2001-11-18  Seth Robertson  <seth@winwood.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.variables: USING_INSIGHT now working.

2001-11-13  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.production: add -classpath $(BK_JAVADIR) to javac rule

2001-11-12  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.production (BK_JAVA_PKG_LOCALE): locale resource bundle support
	(BK_JAVA_PKG_TCLASS): test class support
	(BK_JAVA_PKG_AUX): auxiliary file [image, etc.] support

2001-11-12  James Tanis  <jtt@winwood.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.variables: NO_OPT and NO_DEBUG now supported.

2001-11-09  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.production: tweaks to java jar building rules

	* Make.variables (ECHO): ECHO should be shell builtin

	* Make.config.in (PERL): find perl; don't look for echo program

	* configure.in: reordered by group; find perl; don't look for echo

	* configure: rebuilt with local copy of autoconf 2.52 for good LN_S

2001-11-08  Seth Robertson  <seth@startide.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.targets (doxygen): Modified doxygen target to nuke
	doxy-files to prevent stale files from lying around.

2001-11-08  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* configure (LN_S): regenerated with newer autoconf 2.52; configure
	tweaked to avoid use of ln -s on cygwin [non-cygwin progs ignore .lnk]

	* configure.in: find java compiler and archiver, check for symbolic
	link support, avoid confusion between $PWD envar and pwd program,
	find IE browser on Windows platforms correctly

	* Make.config.in (JAVAC,JAR,LN_S,PWD): add java compiler and archiver,
	check for symbolic link support, avoid confusion between $PWD envar and
	pwd program

	* Make.production (BK_JAVA_*): add java build rules

	* Make.targets (install): add Java jar install target

	* Make.variables (JARFLAGS): default flags for jar'ing java classes

	* Make.bkvariables: spelling fixes, avoid BK_PKGNAME with space

	* ex.hints: spelling fixes
	
	* ex.pkg.Make.preinclude: renamed from ex.pkg.Make.preinstall

2001-11-06  James Tanis  <jtt@winwood.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.targets ($(BK_INSTALLDOCDIR)/doxygen/Doxyfile): Extract
	static functions too.

	* configure.in: Add a few more program checks.

	* Make.targets ($(BK_INSTALLDOCDIR)/doxygen/Doxyfile): Do doxygen
	stuff. 

2001-10-04  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.targets (install): use ${INSTALL_INCFLAGS} for ${BK_PUBLIC_INC}

	* Make.variables (INSTALL_INCFLAGS): install header files
	read-only to avoid editing them [and not originals]
	(INSTALL): removed--install doesn't always grok -c, and autoconf
	finds install with that semantics or uses install-sh shell script
	[so INSTALL from Make.config is always good enough]

	* Make.config.in (RM_CONFIG,MKDIR_CONFIG): eliminate duplicate -f,-p

2001-09-08  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.targets (subtags): Only tag if we have targets.

	* Make.variables (ETAGS): Need tag commands

2001-09-07  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.targets: Install need subdirrule in front of local targets
	as well.

2001-09-05  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.targets (default): Build subdirectories before local targets.

2001-08-26  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.variables: Working library vpath style
	* Make.production: New library dependency style
	* Make.include (BKMKDIR): Need to include dependancy information.

2001-07-05  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.variables (MKDEP): Remove := immediate assignment to allow
	deferred configuration to work correctly.

2001-06-20  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.bkvariables: Move autoconfigure stuff into Make.bkvariables which
	has once-only support and otherwise deals with arch stuff.

	* Make.variables: Support to use configured discovered compiler
	names and other programs.

	* Make.config.in: Don't define CC and CXX directly--there might be
	args.  This applies to RM, MKDIR and friends as well.
