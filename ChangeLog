	* Make.targets (install): use ${INSTALL_INCFLAGS} for ${BK_PUBLIC_INC}

	* Make.variables (INSTALL_INCFLAGS): install header files
	read-only to avoid editing them [and not originals]
	(INSTALL): removed--install doesn't always grok -c, and autoconf
	finds install with that semantics or uses install-sh shell script
	[so INSTALL from Make.config is always good enough]

	* Make.config.in (RM_CONFIG,MKDIR_CONFIG): eliminate duplicate -f,-p

	* Make.targets (subtags): Only tag if we have targets.

	* Make.variables (ETAGS): Need tag commands

	* Make.targets: Install need subdirrule in front of local targets
	as well.

	* Make.targets (default): Build subdirectories before local targets.

	* Make.variables: Working library vpath style
	* Make.production: New library dependency style
	* Make.include (BKMKDIR): Need to include dependancy information.

	* Make.variables (MKDEP): Remove := immediate assignment to allow
	deferred configuration to work correctly.

2001-06-20  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.bkvariables: Move autoconfigure stuff into Make.bkvariables which
	has once-only support and otherwise deals with arch stuff.

	* Make.variables: Support to use configured discovered compiler
	names and other programs.

	* Make.config.in: Don't define CC and CXX directly--there might be
	args.  This applies to RM, MKDIR and friends as well.
