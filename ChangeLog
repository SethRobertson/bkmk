	* configure (LN_S): regenerated with newer autoconf 2.52; configure
	tweaked to avoid use of ln -s on cygwin [non-cygwin progs ignore .lnk]

	* configure.in: find java compiler and archiver, check for symbolic
	link support, avoid confusion between $PWD envar and pwd program,
	find IE browser on Windows platforms correctly

	* Make.config.in (JAVAC,JAR,LN_S,PWD): add java compiler and archiver,
	check for symbolic link support, avoid confusion between $PWD envar and
	pwd program

	* Make.production (BK_JAVA_*): add java build rules

	* Make.targets (install): add Java jar install target

	* Make.variables (JARFLAGS): default flags for jar'ing java classes

	* Make.bkvariables: spelling fixes, avoid BK_PKGNAME with space

	* ex.hints: spelling fixes
	
	* ex.pkg.Make.preinclude: renamed from ex.pkg.Make.preinstall

2001-11-06  James Tanis  <jtt@winwood.sysdetect.com>

	* Make.targets ($(BK_INSTALLDOCDIR)/doxygen/Doxyfile): Extract
	static functions too.

	* configure.in: Add a few more program checks.

	* Make.targets ($(BK_INSTALLDOCDIR)/doxygen/Doxyfile): Do doxygen
	stuff. 

2001-10-04  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* Make.targets (install): use ${INSTALL_INCFLAGS} for ${BK_PUBLIC_INC}

	* Make.variables (INSTALL_INCFLAGS): install header files
	read-only to avoid editing them [and not originals]
	(INSTALL): removed--install doesn't always grok -c, and autoconf
	finds install with that semantics or uses install-sh shell script
	[so INSTALL from Make.config is always good enough]

	* Make.config.in (RM_CONFIG,MKDIR_CONFIG): eliminate duplicate -f,-p

2001-09-08  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.targets (subtags): Only tag if we have targets.

	* Make.variables (ETAGS): Need tag commands

2001-09-07  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.targets: Install need subdirrule in front of local targets
	as well.

2001-09-05  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.targets (default): Build subdirectories before local targets.

2001-08-26  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.variables: Working library vpath style
	* Make.production: New library dependency style
	* Make.include (BKMKDIR): Need to include dependancy information.

2001-07-05  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.variables (MKDEP): Remove := immediate assignment to allow
	deferred configuration to work correctly.

2001-06-20  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Make.bkvariables: Move autoconfigure stuff into Make.bkvariables which
	has once-only support and otherwise deals with arch stuff.

	* Make.variables: Support to use configured discovered compiler
	names and other programs.

	* Make.config.in: Don't define CC and CXX directly--there might be
	args.  This applies to RM, MKDIR and friends as well.
