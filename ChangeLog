	* Make.variables (MKDEP): Remove := immediate assignment to allow
	deferred configuration to work correctly.

	* Make.bkvariables: Move autoconfigure stuff into Make.bkvariables which
	has once-only support and otherwise deals with arch stuff.

	* Make.variables: Support to use configured discovered compiler
	names and other programs.

	* Make.config.in: Don't define CC and CXX directly--there might be
	args.  This applies to RM, MKDIR and friends as well.
