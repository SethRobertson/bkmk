# This is a rather heavy handed way of solving the static build problem on
# RH9, but since this is not really a supported platform and static builds
# are (no longer) required for Insure (which is the really the reason we
# build on RH9 at all any more), I'm not too concerned about a little
# grotesqueness here.
