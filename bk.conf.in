# <TRICKY bugid="2576">These really aren't a configuration option that should
# ever be changed (unless someone has gone crazy and hacked the dynamic linker
# on the OS); it is simply the easiest mechanism to get platform definitions to
# scripts like worker.sh (and jump.pl/wump.pl and the installation scripts,
# if/when they are updated to look at this).  The downside is that it makes the
# configuration file platform-dependent.</TRICKY>
