# <KLUDGE bugid="2576">This really isn't a configuration option (unless you've
# gone crazy and hacked the dynamic linker on your OS); it is simply the
# easiest mechanism to get the platform definition to scripts like worker.sh
# (and jump.pl/wump.pl and the installation scripts, if/when they are updated
# to look at this).  The downside is that it makes the configuration file
# platform-dependent.</KLUDGE>
